The following will be performed:
A cystoscopy is where the doctor looks and examines the 
inside of the bladder and urethra using a fine telescopic-type 
instrument called a cystoscope.
C. Risks of a cystoscopy
There are risks and complications with this procedure. They 
include but are not limited to the following.
General risks:
• Infection can occur, requiring antibiotics and further 
treatment.
• Bleeding could occur and may require a return to the 
operating room. Bleeding is more common if you have 
been taking blood thinning drugs such as Warfarin, 
Aspirin, Clopidogrel (Plavix or Iscover) or Dipyridamole 
(Persantin or Asasantin).
• Small areas of the lung can collapse, increasing the risk 
of chest infection. This may need antibiotics and 
physiotherapy.
• Increased risk in obese people of wound infection, chest 
infection, heart and lung complications, and thrombosis.
• Heart attack or stroke could occur due to the strain on 
the heart.
• Blood clot in the leg (DVT) causing pain and swelling. In 
rare cases part of the clot may break off and go to the 
lungs.
• Death as a result of this procedure is possible.
Specific risks: 
• Rarely damage to the urethra. A false passage may be 
produced causing leakage of urine or in the long term, a 
narrowing that may affect flow of urine.
• Damage to the bladder by puncturing the bladder wall. 
This may need further surgery.
• Swelling at the exit of the bladder which may stop the 
passage of urine. A tube (catheter) may need to be 
inserted to drain the urine until the swelling goes down.
• Bacteria may get into the blood stream with the 
development of septicaemia. Further treatment with 
antibiotics may be necessary.
• Bleeding which may stain the urine colour and 
sometimes cause blockage of urine flow.
• Burning and scalding of urine for a few days after the 
procedure. This usually settles.
• Further procedures may be required if it cannot be done 
at the time of cystoscopy.
